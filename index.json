This paper presents a hypothesis surrounding a novel, multi-agent zone-based delivery optimization framework devised to improve the efficacy and sustainability of last-mile deliveries. By limiting each agent to a certain geographic area, the suggested system departs from conventional single-agent approaches and balances rapid delivery with a decrease in vehicle traffic. This hypothesis capitalizes on the synergy of geofencing, real-time agent tracking, and strategic route planning, to revolutionize the dispatch and delivery of goods. Our proposed framework distinguishes itself from existing literature by asserting that a multi-agent configuration allows for a robust and flexible response to fluctuating demands, a feature not commonly addressed in conventional systems. Through a theoretical model, we hypothesize that localized delivery zones will ensure a more equitable distribution of delivery tasks and an improved Relative Efficiency Ratio during peak demand periods to promote more streamlined route planning. This research contributes valuable insights into enhancing reliability in last-mile deliveries through innovative design strategies.","tags":[],"title":"A Multi-Agent Framework for Zone-Based Last-Mile Delivery Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aayush Nair","Shashwat Bhatnagar","Kathiravan Srinivasan","R Manoov"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1741714684,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1741714684,"objectID":"3649e5e4bbbe710cd41d05d16c8497a1","permalink":"https://manoov.github.io/publication/lithium2024/","publishdate":"2025-09-11T23:08:04+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/lithium2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Lithium-ion batteries are integral to various systems, including electric vehicles and warehouses, where estimating their operational lifespan is critical. This lifespan, known as Remaining Useful Life (RUL), helps in optimizing performance and maintenance. Accurate RUL prediction helps avoid unexpected breakdowns and lowers maintenance costs, making these systems more reliable. This paper introduces a novel approach using a Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) Enhanced Informer model to address challenges in long-term time series forecasting for RUL prediction. By integrating RoPE into the Informer, the model efficiently preserves positional information and leverages sparse attention mechanisms to reduce computational complexity, enabling it to handle longer sequences with minimal memory usage. The proposed model was tested on benchmark datasets, where it outperformed peer level approaches in terms of Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error. The results show a significant reduction in validation errors, indicating the model’s superior generalization ability and its robustness against overfitting. This approach offers a scalable solution suitable for real-time predictive maintenance, particularly in resource-constrained environments. The combination of advanced positional encoding with the Informer architecture demonstrates the potential for this method to enhance battery management and improve the accuracy of RUL prediction across various industrial applications.","tags":["Lithium-ion batteries","Rotary Positional Embedding","Remaining Useful Life","Adaptation models","Accuracy","Attention mechanisms","Computational modeling","Time series analysis","Predictive models","Robustness","Real-time systems","Predictive maintenance","Rotary Positional Embedding","Informer Model","Deep Learning","Battery Management Systems"],"title":"A Novel RoPE-Enhanced Informer Approach for Accurate Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Lithium-Ion Batteries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dr. Manoov R"],"categories":[],"content":" Downloadable LaTex Template for professional Academic Presentations (Ideal for PhD Students) Download the LaTex Template: Access the template in two convenient ways: 1.

Course Design for formative/summative assessments. Strategies to effectively Use Moodle to teach, assess and communicate with your learners. About Moodle LMS Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment (MOODLE) Helps Educator to create personalised learning environments using Moodle Activities and Resources. Approx. 213 million users worldwide. Recently MoodleUS was lauched. Source: https://stats.moodle.org/ Moodle delivers a powerful set of learner-centric tools and collaborative learning environments that empower both teaching and learning. Design and development of Moodle is guided by a “social constructionist pedagogy”. Free with no licensing fees - Moodle is provided freely as Open Source software, under the GNU General Public License. Formative Assessment/Evaluation The concept of “formative evaluation” was introduced by Scriven (1967) - ‘Scriven, M. (1967). The Methodology of Evaluation. In R. W. Tyler, R. M. Gagne, \u0026amp; M. Scriven (Eds.), Perspectives of Curriculum Evaluation Chicago (pp. 39-83)’ Formative VS Summative assessment Formative Summative In-class discussions Instructor-created exams Clicker questions Standardized tests Low-stakes group work Final projects Weekly quizzes Final essays 1-minute reflection writing assignments Final presentations Homework assignments Final reports Good feedback practice: helps clarify what good performance is (goals, criteria, expected standards); facilitates the development of self-assessment (reflection) in learning; delivers high quality information to students about their learning; encourages teacher and peer dialogue around learning; encourages positive motivational beliefs and self-esteem; provides opportunities to close the gap between current and desired performance; provides information to teachers that can be used to help shape teaching. Formative assessment of student Projects using Moodle Assignment activity Rubrics based evaluation: Sample activity: https://moovit.vit.ac.in/grade/grading/manage.php?areaid=2906 Students create group as a activity (Using Moodle Group Self-Selection activity). Students choose time slot for review as specified by Faculty. (Moodle Scheduler plugin). Feedback to entire group and reopening submission if required. Link based submissions for Project demo with audio explanation. Sample activity: https://moovit.vit.ac.in/mod/assign/view.php?id=28808\u0026amp;rownum=0\u0026amp;action=grader\u0026amp;userid=93687 Encourage and facilitate online discussions with Moodle forums The Forum activity allows students and teachers to exchange ideas by posting comments as part of a ’thread\u0026#39;. Sample activity: https://moovit.vit.ac.in/mod/forum/view.php?id=22116 Peer learning using Moodle Database plugin The Database activity allows the teacher and/or students to build, display and search a bank of record entries about any conceivable topic. Sample Activity: https://moovit.vit.ac.in/mod/data/view.php?id=28033 Engage Learners with Gamification in Moodle Develop learning pathways - incentivise your learners to follow pre-defined learning routes to attain the knowledge or skills\nSample Activity: https://moovit.vit.ac.in/blocks/xp/index.php/ladder/10572\nPeer assessment using workshop activity Workshop is a powerful peer assessment activity. Students add submissions which are then distributed amongst their peers for assessment based on a grading scale specified by the teacher.
