abstract="In an era characterized by the rapid expansion of e-commerce, last-mile logistics emerges as a pivotal yet complex component of the supply chain, often plagued by inefficiencies and environmental implications. This paper presents a hypothesis surrounding a novel, multi-agent zone-based delivery optimization framework devised to improve the efficacy and sustainability of last-mile deliveries. By limiting each agent to a certain geographic area, the suggested system departs from conventional single-agent approaches and balances rapid delivery with a decrease in vehicle traffic. This hypothesis capitalizes on the synergy of geofencing, real-time agent tracking, and strategic route planning, to revolutionize the dispatch and delivery of goods. Our proposed framework distinguishes itself from existing literature by asserting that a multi-agent configuration allows for a robust and flexible response to fluctuating demands, a feature not commonly addressed in conventional systems. Through a theoretical model, we hypothesize that localized delivery zones will ensure a more equitable distribution of delivery tasks and an improved Relative Efficiency Ratio during peak demand periods to promote more streamlined route planning. This research contributes valuable insights into enhancing reliability in last-mile deliveries through innovative design strategies.",
