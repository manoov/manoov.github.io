abstract="Cloud computing technology is emerging rapidly due to increasing demand of service required by the different organizations, institutions, and individuals. Nonetheless, the data in the cloud environment is still not completely secure from the outside and inside intrusions and attacks. In this paper, an improvised approach for securing the data in cloud computing environment using parallel and multistage security mechanism (PMSSM) is proposed to provide simultaneous security checks and procedural multistage security using authentication techniques, intrusion detection and encryption. By taking this approach into consideration, the chances of identifying the attack can be increased as the parallelism in the verification and multistage security will enhance the probability of identifying the intrusion or the attack being performed by the attacker. Also, considering the dynamic nature of the intrusion, the parallel and multistage security can help in avoiding such scenario. The discussion of the proposed mechanism suggested that this model can be used to provide enhanced cloud data security to the cloud users.",
