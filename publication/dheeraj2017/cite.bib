  abstract={In the current evergrowing traffic, security is one of the biggest concerns during travel. From airbags and ABS to EBD and automatic braking, work is on to make road travel more secure by the day. This project describes a design and implementation of an effective alert system to monitor an automobile's condition during travel. It is designed to send out an alert in case the vehicle has met with an accident. Our design of the system uses the in-built vibration sensor in the Airbag Electronic Control Unit to detect the abrupt vibrations from the occurrence of an accident. This detection and messaging system is composed of a GPS receiver, a microcontroller and a GSM modem. This enables the monitoring of the vehicle and in the event of an accident; it can immediately be intimated to the emergency services.},
